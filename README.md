In 2022, my founder invested in pre-seed tokens on Solana and got scammed. This inspired him to create change. He founded Pre-Seeds—a decentralized protocol that allows people to invest in pre-seeds of projects without fear of scams. The smart contract ensures investor protection. No more scammers.

Take my founder’s vision and code, and commit it to the decentralized world. We’re building the next billion-dollar protocol on Viction.
